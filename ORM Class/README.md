# ORM Class

## LEGAL

This code is provided AS-IS, and comes with NO support.
If you wish to improve the library, you are free to do so without my permission.
If you wish to give me credit, I welcome that but do not require it.

## INTRO

ORM Class is a wrapper for the Redbean library <http://redbeanphp.com>.

This streamlines the process of using that library and removes redundant
code usage from our solution, resulting in better managed code.

This is a simple CRUD wrapper to better streamline the readbean Code.
Redbean has a lot under hood, check out their website to see else it can do.

## EXAMPLE

I have provided examples in this folder, you just need to supply the test data to try on your own.
